        <p>Baking was my way of relaxing. I loved the smile and peopleâ€™s faces when they taste my cake , and it gave me a strong push to come up with something better. I loved the compliments I get from everyone anytime I bake something extraordinary. They were proud I found something I love and could keep to it.

            Each time I bake, I feel a spark of joy in my soul. It felt like I was born to mix flour and make magic from it. I have other hobbies, no doubt, but none can compare to my love for baking. </p>
